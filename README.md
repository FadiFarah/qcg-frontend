# Project Title

Quartets Card Educational Game

## Description
You might know this famous game and maybe played with your family, our interactive game is the same and you can play between 2 up to 4 people. All the players start with 4 cards in their hand and each category include 9 quartets.
Our goal is to give you the best experience online which will be very similar (and maybe better) than reality. 

Ok, Lets Start! 

Before you create a new game, you have to sign up/log in, find a free room and wait for the other players to log in. It might take a while, so be patient. If you forgot the rules, or if it's your first time playing, that's ok. You can always navigate to the Rules section by clicking The 'RULES' button on the of the screen. 

The winner is the player with the highest number of quartets, so have fun and lets hope you will be the winner of your table!
